# NALMS (Not Another LMS)
NALMS is the REDCap project intended to deliver the DART learning pathways to learners.

The purpose of this repository is to create the files needed for that project, inlcuding:
- zip files of REDCap Forms
- ASI (Automated Survey Invitations)

Ultimately a user should be able to create a pathway using section headings and module names, and then generate all files needed to create that pathway on REDCap.
